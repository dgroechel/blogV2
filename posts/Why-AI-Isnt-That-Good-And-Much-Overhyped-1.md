Artificial intelligence is often overhyped. Promises to replace humans and take over the world have fallen short. AI systems aren't perfect and that's why you shouldn't be scared. It's okay to trust them and to give them power. We've been promised AI for decades, and it hasn't happened.

Why? Because AI is not as good as people. And people are not that good. So when you set your sights on the human level, you have a lot of work to do.

<h2>AI's Promise to Replace Humans</h2>

When we first developed computer programs, we promised to replace humans. We promised automation. We predicted mass unemployment. We predicted a new economic age of leisure and plenty. Then, we gave people jobs. Not real jobs, but just enough to make it worth their time. This isn't a new story.

<h2>Now that we have AI, we again have promised to replace humans.</h2>

You could almost see it coming. Once computers began to outperform humans, the economists of the time were quick to point out how wrong we had been. The AI vs. human race didn't turn out to be AI replacing humans. It was humans playing chess and checkers, driving cars, performing data analysis, and teaching classes in machine learning. We just couldn't replace humans. Instead, humans were using these tasks to make up for the deficiencies of AI. This isn't to say that these are useless jobs, but the idea that we can replace them with AI is flawed. AI can replace only a subset of the tasks they currently do.

 <h2>A More Realistic Way to Think About AI is as a “Helper,” Not as a Way to Replace the Human Workforce</h2>

As of right now, machines can’t “think” for themselves like humans can because AI and machine learning are just math.

AI is most advantageous for simple tasks that 10/10 people would typically complete the same way. Examples of such being data entry, image recognition, and text completion. The two reasons AI is superior in these instances are:

<ol>
 <li>Its quicker than humans and </li>
<li>It cannot lose focus and succumb to laziness or outside distractions</li>
</ol>

 However, where AI lacks in comparison to work humans can produce is for tasks that can be completed in different ways. Using AI for these types of tasks could more likely spit out mixed, potentially incomplete results because there isn’t a clear cut way for a computer to complete the task, whereas humans would have the ability to troubleshoot and work around issues as they arise. Here's an example of using GPT-3 with mixed results:

In the end, AI is a great tool to help speed up your processes but not completely replace humans right now. So the next time you hear someone like Elon Musk say “full self-driving is coming soon” or “AI is going to take over the world” -- take a step back and think about what AI can do.
